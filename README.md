# PacMan
My own game created in Java during 2nd semester PJATK studies.


Paths are set to './Data/...'.  While creating this project in IntelliJ IDEA source code files were inside './src' folder and all data was inside './Data'. 
So unpack 'Data.zip' to main project directory.   ('Data' and 'src' (containing source code files) folders should be aside each other).
